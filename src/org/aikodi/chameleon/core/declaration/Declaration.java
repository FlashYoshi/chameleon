/**
 * A declaration introduces an element that can be referenced from other parts of the code.
 * Examples include types, methods, and variables.
 * 
 * Each declaration has a signature, which is used to identify that declaration. Information
 * that is not used for identification, such as the return type of a method, does not belong in
 * the signature. Therefore, it can be that a specific declaration has a signature that is derived.
 * A Method, for example, has a MethodHeader which contains all the information that is required to
 * compute the signature.
 * 
 * Each declaration results in the lookup of an actual declaration of type D. This type ensures that 
 * if a declaration is just a stub, such as a generic parameter, the transformation performed by the resolveForResult 
 * method returns a declaration of the same family. In case of a type parameter, this ensures that the stub type will be transformed
 * into a type.
