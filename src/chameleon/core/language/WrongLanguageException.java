/**
 * This class of exceptions signals a mismatch between the language of an element
 * and the type of language that it expects.
 * 
 * Statically enforcing this would make the burden of generics even higher. In addition, that approach
 * would only help if generic parameters are always filled in, which is impossible for recursively constrained
 * parameters in some cases. We therefore opted to throw a WrongLanguageException, which is a subclass of
 * ChameleonProgrammerException. If the language is wrong, that is an error in the language module.
