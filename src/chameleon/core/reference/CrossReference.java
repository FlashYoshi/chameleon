/**
 * This interface represents the concept of a cross-reference in the model. A construct is a cross-reference if it points
 * to another element in the model instead of containing it as a descendant or having it as an ancestor. For example,
 * when a variable is access in source code, the variable is referenced by writing the name of that variable. It
 * is the job of the lookup mechanism to find out which variable that is. 
 * 
 * Cross-references are <b>never</b> modeled with direct object references. Instead a cross-reference offers the {@link #getElement()}
 * method to obtain the referenced object. Internally, a cross-reference may store direct references in its cache, but these
 * are cleared when the model is modified. The reason for this choice is twofold. First, when a part of the model is modified, it
 * is very hard to find out which cross-references points to a different element (possibly none) after the change. In most cases,
 * every cross-reference in the entire model could be affected. But most importantly, this way of modeling corresponds directly
 * to the semantics of the code. The variable name "a" in the source code is not tied to a particular variable with name "a".
 * Instead, its semantics is that it refers to whatever variable with name "a" that it in scope in the current state of the 
 * model. If we remove the variable that it currently refers to, it will simply refer to another variable with name "a" in scope
 * (if such a variable exists).
 * 
 * All logical structures are implemented in terms of cross-references. For example, a subclass relation will contain a
 * cross-reference that points to the superclass.
 * 
 * Note that the result of {@link #getElement()} is not necessarily a part of the base model. For example a C# property also
 * defines methods. These references will be found by the lookup mechanism, but they are not part of the base C# model. In
 * case of such generated elements, the {@link #getDeclarator()} method will return the element that generated the referenced
 * element.
