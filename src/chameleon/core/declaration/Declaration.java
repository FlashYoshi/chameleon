 * A declaration introduces an element that can be referenced from other parts of the code.

 * <S>
 * Each declaration has a signature, which is used to identify that declaration. Information
 * that is not used for identification, such as the return type of a method, does not belong in
 * the signature.
 * 
 * <D> Each declaration results in the lookup of an actual declaration of type D. This type ensures that 
 * if a declaration is just a stub, such as a generic parameter, the transformation performed by the resolveForResult 
 * method returns a declaration of the same family. In case of a type parameter, this ensures that the stub type will be transformed
 * into a type.
