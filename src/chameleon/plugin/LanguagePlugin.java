/**
 * An interface for plugins that offer additional functionality to a tool. 
 * 
 * A tool sometimes needs functionality that cannot be provided in the language
 * module itself because it would introduce tool-specific code. Methods that offer
 * this functionality are placed in a specific Plugin interface.
 * To be able to use a particular language with that tool, that interface must be
 * implemented for that language, and an object of that plugin implementation must be added
 * to the language object of the model using the setPlugin method in Language. 
 * The tool requests the connector object using the getPlugin(PluginInterface.class) 
 * method in Language.
 * 
 * For each plugin interface, there is only one plugin implementation attached to a language.
 * If multiple 'plugins' can be added, you must use the Processor interface.
