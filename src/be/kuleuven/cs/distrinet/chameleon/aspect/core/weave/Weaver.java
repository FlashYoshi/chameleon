/**
 * 	FIXME: change comments due to returning of WeavingEncapsulator<T, U> in some methods
 * 
 * 	This interface represents an element weaver. It has the responsibility to tie the different strategies together that allow weaving, as outlined below:
 * 
 * 		- 	First, it declares the <em>WeaveResultProvider</em>. This returns what the join point is transformed into by weaving.
 * 			This can differ by the advice type.
 * 			
 * 				Example 1: MethodInvocations
 * 				Here we have the same result for all different types. The join point (a method invocation) is simply transformed into a
 * 				different method invocation.
 * 
 * 		-	Second, it declares the <em>AdviceTransformationProvider</em>. This provides an opportunity to transform advice code, if this is necessary.
 *			Again, this can differ by the advice type.
 *
 *				Example 1: MethodInvocations
 *				The TranslationStrategy for method invocations is to create a new static method in a new class (denoting the aspect), if it doesn't exist yet.
 *				Note that, since the method is different for different advice types, this is differed by advice type.
 *		
 *		-	Third, it connects these two through a <em>WeavingProvider</em>. This outlines how the join point and the weaveResultProvider are connected.
 *
 *				Example 1: MethodInvocations
 *				Remember, the join point is a method invocation and so is the result of the weaver. We simply swap these to correctly implement
 *				the weaving.
 * 
 * 	All weavers are used together in a chain of responsibility.
