	 * A lexical lookup is used for an element that is not declared relative to another element

	 * 
	 * The lexical lookup strategy uses the given local lookup strategy to perform
	 * a local search. If it does not find anything, it then usually travels upward in the 
	 * lexical structure to continue the search. Note that the search does not always continue
	 * at the lexical parent, though that is the default behavior. Sometimes, for example, the
	 * search must continue at a lexical sibling.
	 * 
	 * By default, this method returns a LexicalLookupStrategy object.
	 * @param local
	 *        The local lookup strategy that is used to perform the local search.
	 * @param element
	 *        The element in which the lexical search will be performed. This element is
	 *        used to decide which kind of lookup strategy to return. It is not always the
	 *        element in which the local search will be performed.
